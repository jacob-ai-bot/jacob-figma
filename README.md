# JACoB AI Figma Plugin

The live version of the JACoB Figma Plugin is available here: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1326684504185921461/jacob-ai-codegen-connector

This repo is for developers who are looking to self-host JACoB and use the Figma Plugin within their local environment.

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*
*It is a combination of the preact-resizable and preact-tailwind templates.*

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v20
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)
- [JACoB installed and running locally](https://jacb.ai)

### Build the plugin

Update the 'API_URL' variable in the 'constants.ts' file with the endpoint for the JACoB API.
For local development, the value should be:

```
export const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5173/api'
```

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest…` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console, search for and run `Show/Hide Console` via the Quick Actions search bar.
